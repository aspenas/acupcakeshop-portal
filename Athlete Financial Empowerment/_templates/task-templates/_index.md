# Task Templates

Standard templates for task management, workflow tracking, and project coordination within the Athlete Financial Empowerment project.

## Available Templates

- [Task Template](./task-template.md) - Standard format for team and individual task assignments
  - Organized by team member
  - Includes deadlines and dependencies
  - Tracks completed tasks and backlog items

## Task Management Approach

Our task management approach follows these principles:

1. **Clear Ownership** - Every task has a designated owner
2. **Visible Deadlines** - All tasks include explicit timeframes
3. **Dependency Tracking** - Tasks identify what they depend on
4. **Progress Visibility** - Completed tasks remain visible for tracking
5. **Prioritization** - Tasks include priority levels for focus

## Task Categories

- **Research Tasks** - Market research, competitive analysis, interview scheduling
- **Development Tasks** - Service model development, educational content creation
- **Operational Tasks** - Team coordination, documentation, process improvement
- **Client-Related Tasks** - Interview follow-ups, relationship management

## Task Status Definitions

- **Active** - Currently being worked on
- **Pending** - Awaiting dependency resolution
- **Completed** - Successfully finished
- **Deferred** - Postponed to a future date
- **Backlog** - Not yet scheduled but identified

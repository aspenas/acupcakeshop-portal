This guide provides instructions for installing the enhanced plugin set for the Athlete Financial Empowerment Obsidian vault.

## First Phase Plugins

The first phase of plugin enhancements includes:

1. **Advanced Charts** - Interactive data visualization
2. **DataLoom** - Sophisticated data tables with filtering
3. **Templater** (enhanced usage) - Programmable templates
4. **QuickAdd** - Rapid content creation with macros

## Installation Instructions

### Using the Installation Script

The easiest way to install all plugins is to use the provided installation script:

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the vault directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/patricksmith/obsidian/acupcakeshop
   ```
3. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install_recommended_plugins.sh
   ```
4. Restart Obsidian
5. Enable the newly installed plugins in Settings > Community Plugins

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install plugins manually:

1. Open Obsidian
2. Go to Settings > Community Plugins
3. Turn off Restricted Mode if enabled
4. Click "Browse" to open the Community Plugins browser
5. Search for and install each plugin:
   - Advanced Charts
   - DataLoom
   - Templater (if not already installed)
   - QuickAdd
6. Enable each plugin after installation

## Next Steps

After installing the plugins:

1. Review the [First Phase Plugin Enhancement Guide](Documentation/first_phase_plugin_guide.md) for detailed usage instructions
2. Configure each plugin according to the recommendations
3. Create initial templates and QuickAdd macros
4. Experiment with charts and DataLoom tables
5. Update existing content to leverage new plugin capabilities

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

1. Check that Obsidian is closed before running the script
2. Verify that the `.obsidian/plugins` directory exists
3. Check permissions on the vault directory
4. Try installing plugins manually through the Community Plugins browser
5. Consult the plugin documentation for specific troubleshooting advice

## Future Plugin Phases

This is the first of four planned plugin enhancement phases. Future phases will add:

- Client management capabilities
- Advanced dashboard components
- Integration with external systems
- Additional analytical tools

Each phase will include comprehensive documentation and implementation guidance.

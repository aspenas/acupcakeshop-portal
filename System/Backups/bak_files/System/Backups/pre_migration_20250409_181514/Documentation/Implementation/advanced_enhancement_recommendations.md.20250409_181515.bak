This document outlines recommended next steps to further enhance your Athlete Financial Empowerment Obsidian vault, building upon the foundation we've already implemented.

## Current Implementation Status

The following enhancements have been successfully implemented:

- **Dashboard System**: Four comprehensive dashboards with Dataview queries and visualizations
- **Template System**: Structured templates with proper YAML frontmatter
- **Tagging System**: Hierarchical tag framework with standardized categories
- **Plugin Configuration**: Dataview and Templater plugins configured for optimal use

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Fix Structural Issues

Some minor structural issues were identified that should be addressed:

- ✅ **Removed Empty Problematic Folder**: The empty "Athlete\\" folder has been deleted
- ✅ **Removed Empty Duplicate File**: The empty duplicate index.md file has been removed
- **Empty Directories**: Consider populating or removing these empty directories:
  - `/Athlete Financial Empowerment/02-interviews/industry-professionals/by-role/team-personnel/cap-strategists`
  - `/attachments/images`, `/attachments/documents`, `/attachments/data`

### 2. Complete Tagging Implementation

While the tagging system is in place, full implementation across all content should be completed:

- **Prioritize High-Value Content**: Focus first on interview notes and competitor profiles
- **Use Batch Process**: Use the tagging script to update multiple files at once
- **Verify Tag Consistency**: Ensure tags follow the established conventions
- **Tag Cleanup**: Remove any outdated or inconsistent tags

### 3. Install Recommended Plugins

Based on your knowledge base needs, the following additional plugins would provide significant value:

#### Priority 1 (High Impact, Low Effort)

1. **Kanban**
   - **Benefits**: Visual project management for client projects and advisory workflows
   - **Use Case**: Create boards for athlete client pipelines, tracking financial strategy implementation
   - **Implementation**: Low effort - create a new `Kanban` folder with board files for different workflows

2. **Advanced Tables**
   - **Benefits**: Enhanced table editing with formatting, sorting, and formulas
   - **Use Case**: Create structured competitor comparison tables, fee schedules, and investment analyses
   - **Implementation**: Low effort - works immediately with existing markdown tables

3. **Calendar**
   - **Benefits**: Visual calendar view of notes with date metadata
   - **Use Case**: Track client meetings, deadlines, and athlete career events chronologically

### 4. Enhance Knowledge Connections

To improve the interconnectedness of your knowledge base:

- **Implement MOCs** (Maps of Content): Create hub notes that connect related information
- **Strategic Backlinking**: Add contextual backlinks between related notes
- **Transclusion**: Use block references to reuse important content across multiple notes
- **Graph View Enhancement**: Configure graph view to highlight important relationships

### 5. Implement Advanced Dataview Queries

Building on your existing Dataview implementation:

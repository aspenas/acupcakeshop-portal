# Athlete Financial Empowerment - Tagging System

This document outlines the comprehensive tagging system for the Athlete Financial Empowerment Obsidian vault.

## Tagging Guidelines

1. **Format**: Use kebab-case for multi-word tags (`financial-education` not `financial education`)
2. **Hierarchy**: Use colon for hierarchical tags (`status:active` not `status-active`)
3. **Consistency**: Choose one format for similar concepts and stick with it
4. **Specificity**: Balance between too generic and too specific
5. **Application**: Apply tags in the YAML frontmatter of each note

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with Core Tags**: Begin by applying content type and subject tags
2. **Add Status Tags**: Apply status tags to all content
3. **Add Specificity**: Add more specific tags as needed
4. **Review for Consistency**: Regularly review tag usage for consistency
5. **Refine Over Time**: Adjust the tagging system as the project evolves

## Tag Usage in Queries

Examples of how to use tags in Dataview queries:

```dataview
TABLE file.cday as "Created"
FROM #interview AND #football
SORT file.cday DESC
```

```dataview
TABLE status as "Status", priority as "Priority"
FROM #task AND #status:active
SORT priority DESC
```

## Tag Application in YAML Frontmatter

Example of proper tag application in frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Interview with John Smith"
date: 2025-04-06
tags: [interview, athlete, football, mid-career, contract]
---
```

## Tagging Best Practices

1. Apply tags consistently across similar content
2. Don't over-tag - 3-7 tags per note is usually sufficient
3. Review and update tags as the project evolves
4. Use tags in combination with Dataview for powerful queries
5. Document new tag categories in this reference document
6. Consider tag maintenance as part of regular vault maintenance

## Automated Tag Suggestions

Use templated notes with pre-populated tag options to encourage consistent tagging.

Example in meeting template:
```yaml
---
title: "Meeting: {{title}}"
date: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}
tags: [meeting, {{type}}]
---
```

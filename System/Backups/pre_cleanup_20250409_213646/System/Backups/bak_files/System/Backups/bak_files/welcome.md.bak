# Welcome to Your Enhanced Obsidian Vault

This document provides an overview of the enhancements that have been implemented to transform your Athlete Financial Empowerment Obsidian vault into a more powerful and interconnected knowledge management system.

## Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Maps of Content (MOCs)

Four comprehensive Maps of Content have been created in the `/Maps` directory:

- **[Competitor Landscape](Maps/map-competitor-landscape.md)**: Comprehensive view of all competitor analysis resources
- **[Athlete Interviews](Maps/map-athlete-interviews.md)**: Organized insights from player interviews
- **[Service Models](Maps/map-service-models.md)**: Overview of service model resources and strategies
- **[Strategic Planning](Maps/map-strategic-planning.md)**: Hub for all strategic planning documents

These MOCs serve as navigation hubs for different areas of your knowledge base, making it easier to find and connect related information.

### 2. Enhanced Backlinking

Strategic backlinks have been added to key documents, creating bidirectional connections between related notes. These connections are organized in "Related Resources" sections that categorize links by relevance and explain the connection.

Examples:
- [Integra Wealth Management Profile](Athlete%20Financial%20Empowerment/01-market-research/competitor-profiles/advisors/integra-wealth-management.md)
- [Roquan Smith Interview](Athlete%20Financial%20Empowerment/02-interviews/players/active/2025/04_april/2025-04-06_smith-roquan_ravens_linebacker.md)

### 3. Recommended Plugins

The following plugins have been installed to enhance your Obsidian experience:

- **Kanban**: Create visual boards for project management
- **Advanced Tables**: Enhance table creation and editing
- **Calendar**: Visualize dates and events
- **Tasks**: Advanced task management
- **Excalidraw**: Create visual diagrams directly in Obsidian
- **Projects**: Organize project information

The plugins are ready to be configured once you restart Obsidian.

### 4. Graph View Configuration

The graph view has been configured with:

- **Color Groups**: Different colors for different areas of the vault

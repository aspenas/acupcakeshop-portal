## Player Interview Fix

An additional fix was performed on $(date +%Y-%m-%d) to ensure the richest and most detailed player interview content was recovered:

- **Issue**: The initial recovery used iCloud content for player interviews, which had less detail
- **Fix**: Replaced player interview files with the more comprehensive versions from the broken backup
- **Affected Files**: All player interview files in the 02-interviews directory
- **Details**: 
  - Restored detailed interview content with comprehensive sections
  - Preserved strategic connections at the top of each file
  - Restored more detailed financial concerns, setup, pain points, and action items
  - Fixed position-based player profiles in the by-position directory

The player interview content is now fully recovered with maximum detail and proper structure.

# Conversation Guide for Champ

*Step-by-step workflow of our project development*

## Overview of What We've Built

We've developed a comprehensive system for the Athlete Financial Empowerment initiative, focusing on:

1. Strategic business planning
2. Market and competitor research
3. NFLPA compliance documentation
4. Client interview framework
5. Task management and coordination

This guide will walk you through the development process and key outputs in sequence.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Business Strategy Development

**Key Documents:**
- [Working Sessions](../../06-planning/working-sessions.md) - Strategic working session outline
- [Key Hypotheses](../../06-planning/key-hypotheses.md) - Core assumptions to validate

**Talk Track:** 
"We began by developing our strategic framework, outlining working sessions to validate our business model. Our key hypotheses focus on using interactive financial modeling to improve athlete engagement and outcomes compared to traditional advisory approaches."

### 2. Client Interview Process Development

**Key Documents:**
- [Player Interview Template](../../_templates/interview-templates/player-interview-template.md) - Player call checklist
- [Jaylen Johnson Interview](../../02-interviews/players/active/2025/04_april/2025-04-06_johnson-jaylen_bears_safety.md) - Detailed notes from interview with Jaylen Johnson

**Talk Track:**
"We created a structured interview process for athletes, with specific questions to understand their current advisory relationships, pain points, and needs. We've already interviewed Jaylen Johnson, who provided valuable insights into how players approach financial advisory relationships. His perspective on multi-advisor models and cultural factors in financial decision-making offers great initial insights for our approach."

### 3. Competitor Analysis Framework

**Key Documents:**
- [Competitor Profile Template](../../_templates/competitor-templates/competitor-profile-template.md) - Framework for competitor analysis
- [Integra Wealth Management](../../01-market-research/competitor-profiles/advisors/integra-wealth-management.md) - Detailed profile analysis

**Talk Track:**
"We developed a comprehensive competitor analysis framework to understand the marketplace. Our first profile focuses on Integra Private Wealth Management, founded by former NFL player Marquay Baul. Their key advantage is the founder's credibility as a former athlete, but their approach lacks the interactive modeling component that differentiates our offering."

### 4. NFLPA Compliance Research

**Key Documents:**
- [Registration Requirements](../../05-compliance/registration-requirements.md) - NFLPA requirements summary
- [Advisory Board Research](../../05-compliance/advisory-board-research.md) - Research on former players for advisory positions

**Talk Track:**
"We've documented all NFLPA registration requirements and researched potential advisory board members from the former player community. This research will be crucial for our registration process and establishing credibility with current players."

### 5. Your Strategic Connections Plan

**Key Documents:**
- [Priority Call List](./call-list.md) - Prioritized list for Champ's outreach
- [Team Tasks](../tasks.md) - Team task assignments and coordination

**Talk Track:**
"We've created a prioritized list of industry connections for you to engage with, focusing on current players, team executives, agents, and former players. We've also outlined specific tasks for developing an agent relationship strategy that will help Patrick and Ray begin building connections in this space."

## Suggested Discussion Flow with Champ

   "We've organized all our project materials in an Obsidian vault that syncs across devices. Let me show you how it's structured..."

2. **Discuss Jaylen Johnson interview findings**
   "Our interview with Jaylen revealed several interesting insights about how he approaches financial advisory relationships..."

3. **Review competitor analysis**
   "We've analyzed Integra Wealth Management as our first competitor. Here's what we learned about their approach..."

4. **Walk through your priority call list**
   "We've created a structured call list for you, prioritizing different stakeholder groups..."

5. **Discuss agent relationship strategy**
   "Let's talk about how we want to approach building relationships with agents, and when might be the right time for Patrick and Ray to get involved..."

6. **Agree on next steps**
   "Let's align on your immediate priorities and what information you need from each call..."

## Key Insights to Highlight

1. **From Jaylen Johnson Interview:**
   - Uses a multi-advisor approach with specialized roles
   - Demonstrated sophisticated fee awareness (basis points vs. percentage fees)
   - Emphasized educational components and transparency
   - Identified cultural factors in financial trust-building
   - Exhibited long-term perspective with specific wealth targets

2. **From Competitor Analysis:**
   - Former player credibility is a powerful differentiator
   - Agent relationships drive most client acquisition (60%)
   - "Three-phase" career planning is standard but lacks interactive elements
   - Concierge services are expected at premium price points

3. **From Your Priority Call List:**
   - Start with current player representatives for direct insights
   - Team financial officers can provide institutional perspective
   - Agent relationships will be critical for long-term success
   - Former players can provide both insights and credibility

## Questions to Discuss with Champ

1. Which of the prioritized calls do you feel most comfortable starting with?
2. What additional information would be helpful before your first calls?
3. How should we coordinate findings from your calls with Patrick and Ray's work?
4. What timeline do you envision for the initial round of conversations?
5. When should Patrick and Ray begin engaging with your network directly?

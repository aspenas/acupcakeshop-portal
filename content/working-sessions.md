## KEY DECISIONS REQUIRED

### Strategic Decisions

5. **Pricing Strategy**: Should we maintain the proposed 3-tier fixed fee structure or explore alternatives?

### Tactical Decisions

2. **Pilot Scale**: How many athletes should participate in the pilot program?

3. **Development Priority**: Should we prioritize model sophistication or user experience in initial development?

4. **Partnership Approach**: Should we pursue league/association relationships immediately or focus on direct-to-athlete first?

5. **Funding Timeline**: When should we begin seeking external funding, if at all?

### Open Questions for Research
1. What percentage of athletes currently use professional financial services?

2. What specific features of existing financial services do athletes find most/least valuable?

3. How strong is the correlation between financial education and positive financial outcomes for athletes?

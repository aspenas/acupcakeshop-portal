*Conversation interpreted from audio transcript*
*Interview conducted on April 2025 by Champ*
*Second-year quarterback with the Las Vegas Raiders, former Purdue standout*

## 1. Financial Advisory Relationships

### 1.1 Family Advisory Model

**Champ:** I called to ask something, not football related, but I figured you'd be a good source 'cause you're kind of your own man, you're experienced. And I'm sure you probably deal with this, yourself. Like, did you have, when did you get a financial advisor? First of all, do you have a financial advisor, Second, when did you get a financial advisor if you have one?

**Aidan:** I do, so it's my dad. When I was a little kid and he... yeah, so he handles all my stuff. And it's been, obviously, you expect possibly some hardship where, you know, where do you cross lines between being a dad and being a financial advisor. But it's actually been really great. I can call him anytime I need. He helps me out, answers my, you know, I have a lot of stupid questions.

**Aidan:** You know, I didn't get to do jobs or internships or stuff that normal kids get to do in college and stuff because I was playing sports. So I'm trying to learn about a lot about stuff and making, you know, more of my own thing because he's handling it for me. I did a little bit of NIL my last year, but for the last few years, he's been handling it. So yeah, he's my financial advisor.

**Key Points:**
- Father serves as primary financial advisor
- Relationship started in childhood and continues professionally
- Benefits include constant accessibility and trust
- Recognizes potential challenges in parent-advisor dual role
- Values ongoing financial education despite lack of traditional work experience
- Relationship evolved to include NIL management in college

### 1.2 Educational Journey

**Aidan:** I have a lot of stupid questions that, you know, I didn't get to do jobs or internships or stuff that normal kids get to do in college and stuff because I was playing sports. So I'm trying to learn about a lot about stuff and making, you know, more of my own thing because he's handling it for me.

**Champ:** That's exactly what this thing, like for a person like you, that's exactly what this tool could be used for. It's like, you're so inquisitive that you, you would go get in a rabbit hole of education and learning with it, which I think is really, really cool.

**Aidan:** I mean, you got to send it to me, I'll talk to my dad about it too.

**Key Points:**
- Recognizes knowledge gaps due to athlete development path
- Actively seeking financial education despite having trusted advisor
- Shows interest in supplementary educational resources
- Expresses desire to take ownership of financial knowledge
- Values technological tools that can provide on-demand information
- Would consult with father/advisor about new financial tools

## 2. NIL and Tax Management

### 2.1 NIL Experience

**Champ:** I thought how did the NIL space work? He handled all that in the tax stuff for you and that when you were a college player? That's kind of what I'm getting at. It's like, you know, trying to learn that space because these kids are, you know, they really don't know what they're getting into. And they have like their advisors are kind of taking advantage of them a little bit.

**Aidan:** Yeah, man, it's sketchy. I was super... yeah, there's... First of all, I know a lot of guys out there that probably have put themselves in bad situations because of their advisors. But no, NIL, like, this is... this was obviously when the NCAA just plopped it on people, it's legal now. The tax is obviously not... it's not the sexy topic at the top of the list. So I think people are probably... the kids are probably struggling for that.

**Key Points:**
- Had NIL experience in final year of college
- Acknowledges risks in NIL advisory relationships
- Recognizes lack of tax education as significant issue
- Notes abrupt implementation of NIL rules created confusion
- Has observed peers making poor financial decisions with advisors
- Describes tax implications as overlooked by most college athletes

### 2.2 Tax Management Approach

**Aidan:** So I think, you're not like, the tax situation... you know, I have my dad, we also, I have a guy that does my taxes, but my dad really found him for me, and it kind of through my agency as well, that he had. And that's, you know, what these agencies in the NFL, they have representatives who do taxes for you and who have the experience to do that, and I'm not sure in college, if it's the same same.

**Aidan:** But yeah, I have a tax guy who I set up through my agent, and my dad kind of both, and then I, you know, I just, you know, obviously with everybody else recently. And it's so complex. You know, I'm sure it's a little bit different in college. It's they're probably not getting taxed the same way because every city... Yeah, yeah. So they're not doing it... that's confusing.

**Aidan:** But, the guy who helps me, I mean, I couldn't do that myself. My dad did my taxes my last year in college with the NIL stuff just because it wasn't anything super significant. But then once I got paid my rookie year, I was like, no, we need... you need somebody professionally doing this.

**Key Points:**
- Uses specialized tax professional despite having father as advisor
- Tax professional found through combination of family and agent connections
- Recognizes increasing complexity from college to professional taxes
- Made deliberate choice to upgrade tax support when entering NFL
- Balanced approach using family advisor for overall strategy, specialist for taxes
- Father directly handled simpler college NIL tax situation

### 2.3 Agency-Advisor Relationships

**Champ:** Does your... Do you have to pay extra to your agent to have the tax guy? Or is that part of the...

**Aidan:** I think, I think I paid the tax guy directly. So yeah, he doesn't technically work with the agents. He's not like an employee of the agency. He's his own... He has his own organization. So I pay him directly, but yeah, you have to have to pay him in order to do all that stuff that I wouldn't be able to do in my own.

**Champ:** No, that's good, man. Like, and again, like, I call you because I knew you would handle your stuff and and you've been blessed to have, you know, your dad that kind of handles it, man. Like, because what's happening is these guys are... their agencies are recommending financial advisors, and these financial advisors are, you know, having pay structures that are not always advantageous for the athlete and the athlete they're not even really aware of it because you make so much money right now, so they're not looking at the fees and the transaction that it takes every time.

**Key Points:**
- Direct payment relationship with tax professional
- Clear separation between agent and tax professional
- Understands fee structure for specialized services
- Recognizes value of expert tax preparation
- Has avoided potentially problematic agency-advisor arrangements
- Aware of industry issues with advisors taking advantage of athletes

## 3. Financial Planning Approach

### 3.1 Seasonal Management

**Aidan:** Yeah, so smart, it takes... I, it takes a village, honestly, and I know, like, for me, I try to handle all this stuff in the offseason. When I'm not in the season. Like there's no way I could do it in the season. There's just absolutely, I just don't have time, you know, you know better than anybody. It's just gets so busy. And so I have to handle everything.

**Aidan:** So we actually sat down, me and my wife sat down this offseason, did like a full financial plan with my dad, took a few hours, but he kind of laid out everything that he's investing, why he's investing it, where he sees me in 10, 20, 50 years, and I think having a full view, and it really helps me, and made me take more ownership of it and, you know that, you know, this is my money.

**Key Points:**
- Concentrated financial planning during offseason
- Recognizes impossibility of detailed financial work during season
- Involves spouse in financial planning meetings
- Values comprehensive long-term planning (10, 20, 50 years)
- Appreciates transparency in investment strategy explanations
- Proactively schedules dedicated financial planning time

### 3.2 Educational Resources

**Aidan:** And, you know, when the money gets taken by the government, taken by other things, like, I should care about it because it's mine. So I think people like that, it just takes good people, you know, because there's a lot of bad people out there, and now there's even more money than ever out there. So, yeah, it's scary. I feel scared for a lot of kids to be honest with you. But I think organizations like that, I think you'll start... what you're explaining. I would just have to imagine you'll start seeing more of as it becomes more of a problem and a necessity.

**Champ:** I know, man. Like, if I had a tool that was developed, bro, that, let's say it didn't cost a fee right now, right? Let's say you're almost like a test case, and it's almost like electronic financial advisor. So you got it at home. It's secure, like none of your information can get anywhere, and you can ultimately ask it whatever questions that you want to ask about your future, about your budgeting, about investing and learning more about investments, like, would you be interested in something like that?

**Aidan:** I probably would have to know more about it, but just on the surface, I definitely would. I think. Because that's what I do. I call my dad, I look down freaking ChatGPT for stupid answers to financial questions. Like, I'm always trying to not learn about some of the things that I think are kind of boilerplate that everybody knows, but, you know, I'm trying to figure out for myself. So, no, I think just more resources like that would definitely be something.

**Key Points:**
- Already using AI tools (ChatGPT) for financial education
- Interested in secure, personalized financial education technology
- Values privacy and security in financial technology
- Takes ownership of financial education despite having advisors
- Shows openness to supplementary educational resources
- Recognizes need for basic financial knowledge building

### 3.3 Financial Literacy Challenges

**Aidan:** Just because, I mean, the lingo, like, like in football, how we get into the weeds with the lingo and people, if they don't know football wouldn't know certain terms and stuff, like it's the same way in business. There's just certain terms I call my dad about. I'm like, what does this even mean? And he explains. I'm like, that's super simple. I don't know why I have to call about... Something confusing in new verbiage.

**Champ:** That's exactly what this thing, like for a person like you, that's exactly what this tool could be used for. It's like, you're so inquisitive that you, you would go get in a rabbit hole of education and learning with it, which I think is really, really cool.

**Key Points:**
- Identifies financial terminology as major barrier
- Draws parallel between specialized football and financial languages
- Uses father as translator of complex financial concepts
- Recognizes need for simplified financial education
- Values on-demand answers to financial terminology questions
- Shows natural curiosity that would benefit from educational tools

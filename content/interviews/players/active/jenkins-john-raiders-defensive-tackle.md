**Champ:** Yep. So. Those are... you know, what's funny? Those were the two spots where we were choosing between. And what the difference was Steph didn't want to go to Weston because it wasn't centrally located because I actually like the house in there that we could have rented for more economical pricing, but she wasn't...

*Conversation interpreted from audio transcript*
*Interview conducted on April 2025 by Champ*
*Safety with the Chicago Bears, veteran player focusing on long-term financial security*

## 1. Financial Advisory Relationships

### 1.1 Advisor Selection Process

**Champ:** There's no football junk. Like, you have a financial advisor, right?

**Jaylen:** Yeah.

**Champ:** How did you find your financial advisor?

**Jaylen:** Honestly, I believe... Well, I kind of have two. I don't even call, but my financial advisor... So, like, I was there, so the dude who does, like, investments in stocks and stuff like that... he gave my brother when he was at LA... He gave him an internship to work at his financial firm. Got it. So, I had already had a relationship with buddy, and he's family, family discount, he really good at what he doing and he gonna give me the family discount anyway, so...

**Key Points:**
- Uses multiple financial advisors for different aspects of financial management
- Found primary investment advisor through family connection (brother's internship)
- Values pre-existing relationship and trust factor
- Received "family discount" on services due to personal connection
- Distinguishes between different financial roles (investments vs. broader advising)

### 1.2 Fee Structure

**Champ:** When you say "family discount, like, dive down in a detail. I'm trying to figure out, like, the pay structure of these guys a little bit.

**Jaylen:** So my, the way he charging me, I want to say to, like, you have like, you have a percent versus what they call a base of a beta point or basis point or something like that. So he charges me like... wants to like, 20, 25, like a quarter, on the base is one. So he was saying, like, most investors charge one, like the standard one, maybe like, or anywhere around one is probably like standard or whatever.

**Jaylen:** That's cool. You like, people like, say, okay, they're going to help you out, whatever, then they kind of ranged from half a basis point to a three-quarter or whatever from there from there. He was like, I'm charging you 0.25 of a basis point. And that's the one he was like, that's like the family discount.

**Key Points:**
- Standard industry fee appears to be around 1% (100 basis points)
- Receives significantly discounted rate of 0.25% (25 basis points)
- Aware of typical range of fees (0.5% to 0.75%)
- Understands fee structure is based on assets under management
- Distinguishes between percentage and basis points in fee discussions

### 1.3 AUM Considerations

**Champ:** Did he... Did he lower that once you got paid? Or like where you, was it already?

**Jaylen:** That's what I had when I had a million dollars.

**Champ:** That's good, bro. That's really good.

**Jaylen:** He telling me something to make me mad, but I kind of understood it. He was just like, because I like we working whatever, he was just like, "Yeah, like, I'm not making no money off you. Like, I'm not. It's not..." And he just like, "Yeah, like, you have $2 million dollars, but that's really not any money."

**Jaylen:** Like, bro, there's a lot I ever had. But he's trying to do at the time, like $2 million ain't nothing in me getting in a sense of 0.25 a basis point, I ain't really making no changes off that. But he was just like, it ain't really even about that for you right now. It's just about you just playing, getting that security to where when we do start getting 10 to 15 to 20 million in the account... Now we can start really doing and making something, making some more things happen and taking some more risks, but it's right now, you want to get $2 million, and counting and selling so much that we can, we can do right now because God forbid, if something happen, you can't... He said, a million dollars for the rest of your life ain't a lot of money.

**Key Points:**
- Started with low fee at $1 million portfolio milestone
- Advisor transparent about limited profitability at small account size
- Advisor focused on long-term relationship and growth to $10-20 million
- Conservative approach in early career stages
- Emphasis on security before risk-taking
- Education about lifetime financial needs vs. perceived wealth

## 2. Negative Advisory Experiences

### 2.1 CPA Challenges

**Jaylen:** I had also, like, a different, like, CPA and things like that. CPA was trash. So I had to fire him.

**Champ:** Why was he trash?

**Jaylen:** That's what I like... boom, it was cool. Or not, it was cool. I thought it was cool. So I'm going through season or whatever, of course, we get all the checks or whatever, whatever. My investor guy, he's two, I even two. He was investing my money, kind of being conservative and things like that, trying not to get certain risk started up.

**Jaylen:** So my CPA, he pretty much didn't do shit. He didn't do no planning. We didn't talk about no, for me, I heard about these things. So, and like, I didn't necessarily know, but I knew that something was supposed to be done based on kind of just what I basic knowledge that I know, as far as writing off, maybe donations, different ways to cut your taxes down, the tax holdings any of that stuff. We didn't have no conversation on it.

**Key Points:**
- Separate CPA for tax management initially
- CPA failed to provide proactive tax planning
- No discussion of tax mitigation strategies (deductions, donations, etc.)
- Had basic knowledge of expected tax planning activities
- Identified lack of communication as major issue
- Expected more proactive guidance from CPA

### 2.2 Communication Breakdown

**Jaylen:** So I'm talking to them, whatever, so we get later in the year, it's October and I boom boom... was, "Oh, yeah, now, everything's good. Boom boom." My head in my mouth, like, "Hey, whatever, we're gonna do some tax planning," to hit in December again, like, whatever, whatever, like, "Man, I ain't moved my money nowhere, we ain't... I know, like, what, we doing?" So I know everything's all good. So I'm like, "Sure, okay?"

**Jaylen:** So he said, that's good, that's good. I get down to God. You get hit across the head. I got hit slab across the head. Okay, to hell with buddy, so I'm like, no, I'm cool. I'm not like, "Nah. That's not gonna happen again." So I fired Buddy, boom.

**Key Points:**
- Tax professional assured everything was handled properly
- Experienced significant unexpected tax burden
- Later learned tax planning actions weren't taken
- Breakdown in communication led to financial surprise
- Took decisive action by terminating relationship
- Learned importance of proactive tax planning

### 2.3 Advisory Red Flags

**Jaylen:** So then I start messing with this dude, you might know him, old white buddy. I think he used to be the agent. His name was Steve. I don't want to say Feldman or something like that.

**Champ:** Oh, so yeah, I have heard of him. I have heard of him.

**Jaylen:** He had pretty much like this athlete group. So after that, I forget how he even got in contact with buddy, but I got in contact with buddy. Met or whatever, and he was like, "Yeah, whatever. He has this guy." And his name is Brian. And he was working with it. So I'm like, "Okay, cool."

**Jaylen:** So like, they would, I told him everything I happened, like things that I wanted to be different. So, and he was like, "Yeah, like, we can help you with all your stuff, your taxes, certain payroll, things like that. You want to put your family on payroll?" So, it would really help for... To be honest, that it was help for helping me out. They was talking about tax was holding and this and that, and you couldn't be on in here and do all this. So I'm like, "Okay, cool. I'm business straight or whatever."

**Key Points:**
- Switched to financial advisor with athlete-specific focus
- New advisor promised comprehensive services (taxes, payroll, etc.)
- Discussed employee strategies for family members
- Tax withholding guidance was a key selling point
- Believed problems had been resolved with new advisor
- Advisor projected confidence in fixing previous issues

### 2.4 Warning Signs and Termination

**Jaylen:** And then my agent at the time, his name was Doug, Doug Hendricks. I told him, "Yeah, I work with Steve." I told him I worked on him. He was like, "Steve, who?" And I told him, he was like, I guess he wanted to get some background information. He was like, "Get rid of buddy."

**Jaylen:** And I was like, "Nah, like, he's not what you think he is or whatever." And it's funny because like, when I seen that, like, or when he showed me all that stuff, I was just like, "Man, that's kind of..." someone, like, that did good work, granted, but it feels like, Steve, it always seemed like there was like an end game.

**Jaylen:** When I talked to him, it would, like, be like, "Oh, yeah, like, whatever, you be like, you're gonna be a top player. Like, you gonna make a lot of money, you're going make a lot of money." He just kept talking about money. So I was in, like, everybody kind of always did it. So I didn't think he was doing it. I'm like, "Man, everybody always talk about gonna make a lot of money."

**Key Points:**
- Agent raised concerns about financial advisor
- Initially defended advisor despite warnings
- Recognized pattern of excessive money focus in discussions
- Felt advisor was fixated on future earnings potential
- Eventually discovered problematic background information
- Identified superficial relationship focused on potential earnings

### 2.5 Transition to Trusted Advisor

**Jaylen:** When I see now, I'm like, "Nah, that's something that you about to say. Like, you got to start with that. Like, hey, like, I've been in some trouble..." but no, no. I don't want to go... I'm like, to me, I found that out, and nobody say nothing for a year, a year and a half, I'm like, "Man, y'all sneaky." So, I didn't, I told him like, "Hey, I'm cool, whatever." I ain't even tell him why. I just stop. I'm cool. Like, "Y'all lied to me."

**Jaylen:** So then I started messing with Craig Brown. So my agent put me in Doug putting me in contact with the company, at the time was like, that KB, your somewhere. And something like that, or whatever, but it was pretty much like a lot of top athletes, I know, like, Xavien Howard. M Woodham, Jameis Winston messed with them, Ojack, messed with him. So a lot of people that was already there that mess with him whatever, said he did good work and all. So I started messing with him. And he started taking his team started taking care of me with, like, the taxes, the core stuff like that.

**Key Points:**
- Discovered advisor had undisclosed problematic history
- Felt deliberately misled by lack of transparency
- Quietly terminated relationship without full explanation
- New advisor found through agent recommendation
- New advisory firm had strong reputation with other athletes
- Valued peer recommendations in financial advisor selection

## 3. Current Advisory Structure

### 3.1 Specialized Roles

**Jaylen:** But they more, I would say of like, my, I don't... I would say, my financials, like my... He's not the advisor, advisor.

**Champ:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Jaylen:** But I feel like for me, because like, whenever I'm going to do something, I'll talk to him, like, first. Like, because I feel like my, every, I don't even call my financial advisor, my financial advisor. I call him my investor, but it's like, whenever I want to invest as far as put some money somewhere and in the stock and a REIT or whatever it is, like invest in solar company or whatever the case might be. Like, he brings different deals that's not always stock, the bonds that he even gets in.

**Jaylen:** So I just really call my investor, but as far as I'm my advisor, I'll talk to Craig, honestly, 'cause, like, Craig, he put me on certain business deals and putting me in cahoots to certain people on certain things and franchises, and he talks to me about, like, the money. So to me, he gives me more of the advice because he knows the game pretty much. He ain't doing it for the cuts. Because a certain amount gets no cut off my investments.

### 3.2 Communication and Education

**Jaylen:** They send me my monthly spending. They send me like, reports of what my money doing. I have the app or my investment stuff, so I can see pretty much everything that is going on as far with my investments go and then, shit. They since since the talk, shit, they be calling me now.

**Jaylen:** So, you know, like, my investor who'll call me, like, he just called me, like a day or two ago. We were just talking about, um, I was asking him about the terrorists and the taxes and certain certainties exception what I'm doing and why the market down and certain things like that. And you were saying, like, why the market is getting shot, like because of the way that he goes about doing his investments for me right now, being safe because he felt like the market was going drop big. But he was like, you only not even down. Like everybody's negative, and you still up, like, a quarter percent or something.

### 3.3 Financial Education Emphasis

**Jaylen:** But I think really, it was just me telling them what the hell I want, because even for me, like, like I said, people gave me up or whatever, people that I do or whatever knew them, "Oh, yeah, you doing, this and that. You doing this and that. Well, why don't you do this and this and this and you can make this percent off of this and this and that?"

**Jaylen:** I hit my people up, "Hey, bro. What are these people talking about? Like, they keep saying, I can do this and that and all these different things, and make sure I'm looking into this, I'm looking into that. And y'all said nothing about this shit." So like somebody says... Somebody something to me. Okay. I like, "No, no, no, like..." And like Craig and his team was like, "No, there's things that we go through and this and that. We just don't, like, bring it all to you. So you may not know looking into, not because we don't necessarily bring it to you."

**Jaylen:** I'm like, "I understand that, but, I need to know something, like, maybe I need to start asking questions." Do y'all tell me what we doing, what we not doing, certain things, but I don't like, feeling in the dark to where it's a whole bunch of shit going on. I don't know what we're doing.

**Champ:** Does Craig like, because I know he helps you and he does it. Does he teach you? Does he like instruct you on how?

**Jaylen:** 100% both of them. Okay. Yeah, both of them because... Yeah. They ain't got no choice. So anytime that I we call or they call me and "Hey, whatever, this is going on or whatever, whatever, what you think?" I'm asking questions. That's just what I am.

## 4. Interest in Financial Technology

### 4.1 AI Financial Tool Concept

**Champ:** Would you like, you like, this thing I'm trying to get into, bro, I think you'd be a perfect candidate for. Let's say you could do all of that stuff on your own. And you might be like a pilot case where you get this deal, almost like an app, and you can do everything that all these, that you got this team for, kind of on your own and learn it. But you would manage it. Would you be interested in something like that?

**Champ:** So let's say that I got this system, right, that's that's gonna take in all of your finances, right? It's like a, let's call it a 30 to 45 minute type deal where it's going to take in all of yours stuff. Any questions that you have to ask about your money, your spending, where it's going, or what if you bought a vacation home? Like and no? And the system will answer it. And guess what? Nobody else, you don't have to go to Craig. A matter of fact, you can crosscheck Craig, to see what what he says matches what the system says.

**Champ:** And any question, you can say, okay, let's say, let's say I bought a house in Miami next year that was 6.5 million dollars. How was that going to impact my retirement date? Or how is that going to impact the monthly spending that I want to have for the next year? And this system could provide you that answer. Would you be interested in something like that?

**Champ:** That's what I thought, too. So between you and I, that's some of the junk I'm working on in a background because, like, I want... I want to be able to help y'all.

**Champ:** It's like you're Ricky Carson financial... Yeah, bro, because it's going to learn you. 

**Jaylen:** Exactly, bro. So biggest is a misconception like finances and like people. I feel like people don't understand are, like, finances are just all comfort and percentages. So it's like, once you find out what you set your goal, the number's won't do it itself. See, I'm like, it's really the people, like, a lot of times when it's like, "Okay, I want to get to a million, I want to get to a million." It's like, "Okay. So, what's you gonna do when you get to a million? What's your spending gonna look like? How fast do you want to get to the million?"

**Jaylen:** 1,000%. Yeah, how fast you want to get to 5 million? Because with that, it's like, no, you can't speak. No. Like, oh, yeah, they trying to get to... It's like, with me, I go, "Hey, I'm trying to get to $20 million as perfect as possible to make..." I barely talk to me, like, I haven't bought me a big boy purchase until this year, right?

**Champ:** Trust me, I know, I know you. That's why I called you.

**Jaylen:** Like the, the market and shit like that in general. Like, the market's always gonna be up. Like, so it's like, if I can make 5% off my money and I've got $20 million in investment, if I'm make a 5%, at least, that's a million dollars a year. But that's all stocks and... Just stocks. And that ain't even like an aggressive percentage when you got the right people. You see what I'm saying? Like, that's very safe. And you're going to hit that. Like, you know what I mean?

**Key Points:**
- Clear financial goal of $20 million in investments
- Delayed major purchases until financial stability achieved
- Understands power of compound returns on significant capital
- Goal of generating $1 million annual passive income
- Comfortable with modest 5% return target
- Disciplined approach to building wealth before spending

### 4.4 Financial Education for Black Athletes

**Champ:** Like, what I'm trying to do, and that's why you're going to be perfect for this. I talk to, like, you, Ro and other guys, and I know the responsible cats that can kind of be like just a pilot, just use this product. Don't, no charge, no nothing. Just break it. Use it. And ask all them questions that you ask, and this thing will find it for you. And all you got to do is just listen to it.

**Jaylen:** Now I know that because I got homeboys that ask me about this shit. It's like, I know, like, about it. Like, I have I have enough knowledge about it to talk about it, but then when it comes to them putting it in action, that's where I'm kind of like, "well, I don't... I don't trust you to the least. I don't... I'm not cool with it. Like, I've talked about it, but it's like, I'm not hands on about it."

**Jaylen:** So I feel like doing something like that, and, like, their biggest thing like, "Oh, like, I ain't got no cheese, I don't got no cheese." Like, "You, I ain't got no cheese..." It's deeper than that. I know, you need a certain limit, and then you put the money in the right place. It's easy. I tell you where the right places are... Like, you just put your money in S&P and whatever, like, you don't care about that money. Your ass fat, that money gonna be up. Like, people think, like, it is what it is, but it's like, one of those scams, like, black people just have that investment fear.

**Champ:** Oh, 1000%. Totally agree.

**Jaylen:** We can do it. 1%, bro.

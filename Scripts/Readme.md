# Scripts Directory

> [!info] Note to Obsidian
> This directory contains utility scripts that are not part of the main vault content.
> These scripts are designed to be run externally and should not be processed by Obsidian's parser.
> For performance reasons, we recommend excluding this directory from Obsidian's indexing process.

## Purpose

This directory contains utility scripts for maintaining and enhancing the Obsidian vault. These scripts are not meant to be part of the vault's content but rather tools to help manage it.

## Directory Structure

- `Scripts/` - Main scripts directory
  - `lib/` - Shared library files
  - `*.py`, `*.sh` - Individual utility scripts

## Usage

These scripts should be run from a terminal or command prompt, not from within Obsidian.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal Obsidian performance, consider:

1. Excluding this directory from Obsidian's indexing process
2. Using the lightweight versions of scripts when available
3. Following the guidance in the [Obsidian Performance Optimization Guide](../Documentation/System/obsidian_performance_guide.md)

For more information on script consolidation and optimization, see the [Script Consolidation Documentation](../Documentation/System/script_consolidation_README.md).

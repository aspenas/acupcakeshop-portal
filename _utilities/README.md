# Utilities: Non-Content Tools

> [!NOTE] Obsidian Performance
> This directory is excluded from Obsidian's indexing process via the `.obsidian-ignore` file to improve performance.

This directory contains utility tools and configuration files that support the vault but are not part of its content.

## Directory Structure

- **scripts/**: Automation scripts and utility tools
- **config/**: Configuration files for scripts and systems

## Working with Utilities

1. **Scripts**: Run scripts from a terminal, not from within Obsidian
2. **Configuration**: Review configuration files before running scripts
3. **Execution**: Ensure proper permissions when executing scripts

## Best Practices

1. Document all scripts with clear descriptions and usage instructions
2. Use relative paths in all scripts to ensure portability
3. Store script logs in a dedicated logs directory
4. Maintain backups before making significant changes

## New Directory Structure

The vault has been reorganized into the following structure:

├── content/                      # Primary knowledge content
│   ├── interviews/               # Interview transcripts and analysis
│   ├── research/                 # Research and competitor analysis
│   ├── strategy/                 # Strategic planning and business model
│   └── compliance/               # Regulatory compliance documentation
├── resources/                    # Supporting materials
│   ├── templates/                # Templates for content creation
│   ├── assets/                   # Images, documents, and diagrams
│   └── dashboards/               # Performance dashboards
├── _utilities/                   # Non-content utility tools

## Key Improvements

1. **Logical Organization**: Content is organized by type and purpose
2. **Improved Navigation**: Atlas provides maps of content for easier navigation
3. **Consolidated Resources**: Templates and assets are consolidated in a single location
4. **Performance Optimization**: Utility files excluded from Obsidian indexing
5. **Standardized Metadata**: Consistent frontmatter across all content

## Verification Results

See the [Migration Verification Report](migration_verification_report.md) for detailed verification results and any issues that need attention.

## Next Steps

1. **Address Verification Issues**: Fix any issues identified in the verification report
2. **User Guidance**: Refer to the [Vault User Guide](vault_user_guide.md) for information on using the new structure
3. **Obsidian Restart**: Restart Obsidian to ensure it recognizes the new structure

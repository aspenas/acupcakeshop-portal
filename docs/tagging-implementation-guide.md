```

## Implementation Instructions

1. Create a new note in your vault root called `tag-system.md`
2. Copy the tagging framework above into this file for reference
3. Begin implementing tags in your existing notes using the following guidelines

## Tagging Guidelines

### Tag Usage Rules
- Apply 3-5 tags per note for optimal organization
- Always include at least one primary category tag
- Combine tags from different categories for precise filtering
- Use lowercase, hyphenated format consistently
- Don't create new tags outside the framework without updating the system doc

## Dataview Queries Using Tags

Add these queries to your dashboards to surface content using the tagging system:

### Tasks Dashboard Query
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link as "Task",
  file.ctime as "Created",
  choice(contains(file.tags, "#in-progress"), "üîÑ", choice(contains(file.tags, "#complete"), "‚úÖ", "üìù")) as "Status"
FROM #task
SORT file.ctime desc
```

### Content by Category Query
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link as "Document",
  map(filter(file.tags, (t) => startswith(t, "#")), (t) => substring(t, 1)) as "Tags"
FROM #market-research
GROUP BY choice(contains(file.tags, "#profile"), "Profiles", choice(contains(file.tags, "#summary"), "Summaries", "Other"))
```

### Content Status Overview
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  length(rows) as "Count"
FROM ""
WHERE contains(file.tags, tag)
GROUP BY choice(contains(file.tags, "#draft"), "üìù Draft", 
         choice(contains(file.tags, "#in-progress"), "üîÑ In Progress", 
         choice(contains(file.tags, "#complete"), "‚úÖ Complete", 
         choice(contains(file.tags, "#needs-review"), "üëÄ Needs Review", 
         choice(contains(file.tags, "#archived"), "üóÑÔ∏è Archived", 
         "üè∑Ô∏è Untagged")))))
SORT length(rows) desc
```

## Tag Migration Plan

Follow this process to implement the tagging system across your vault:

1. **Phase 1: Core Structure**
   - Add primary category tags to all existing files
   - Add status tags to all existing files
   - Create the tag system reference file

2. **Phase 2: Detailed Classification**
   - Add content type tags to all files
   - Add subject matter tags to key documents
   - Add entity type tags where applicable

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Organization**
   - Add project management tags to action items
   - Create tag-based dashboards using Dataview
   - Review and refine tags for consistency

4. **Phase 4: Maintenance**
   - Review tag usage monthly
   - Update the tag system as needs evolve
   - Document tag definitions for team clarity

## Best Practices for Ongoing Tag Management

1. **Start with structure**
   - Always apply primary category and status tags at minimum
   - Consider what questions you'll want to answer with your tags

2. **Maintain consistency**
   - Use established tags rather than creating similar variants
   - Follow the formatting conventions exactly

3. **Purpose-driven tagging**
   - Tag for retrieval and organization purposes
   - Consider both browsing and searching use cases

4. **Evolve thoughtfully**
   - Document new tags when you create them
   - Review periodically to consolidate similar tags

5. **Integrate with workflows**
   - Use templates to ensure consistent tag application
   - Create dashboards based on tag combinations

## Tag-Based Dashboards to Create

1. **Project Status Dashboard**
   - Filter by #task and status tags
   - Group by priority or category

2. **Content Inventory Dashboard**
   - Group by primary category and content type
   - Show completion status

3. **Subject Matter Dashboard**
   - Filter by subject tags
   - Group by content type

4. **Entity-Focused Dashboard**
   - Filter by entity type tags
   - Show related content across categories

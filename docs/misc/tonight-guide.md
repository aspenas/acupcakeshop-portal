# Discussion Guide for Tonight

## Key Focus: Maximum Stakeholder Engagement
- Priority is getting Champ on as many calls with as many stakeholders as possible
- Volume and breadth of conversations more valuable than depth at this stage
- Cast wide net across all stakeholder categories

## Listening Framework
- Focus on gathering perspectives rather than presenting our ideas
- Document actual experiences, not reactions to our concepts
- Capture direct quotes and specific examples

## Jaylen Johnson Reference Points
- Found advisor through family connection
- Distinguishes between "investor" and "advisor" roles
- Received preferential fee arrangement (0.25 basis points)
- Values educational components and transparency
- Long-term focus on building $20M before lifestyle spending

## Stakeholder Categories
- Current players at different career stages
- Agents and representation
- Team and league executives
- Current financial advisors
- Former players with different experiences

## Documentation Priorities
- Advisor selection process
- Fee awareness and structure
- Communication frequency and methods
- What they value most in financial relationships
- Current pain points (in their words)

## Discussion Questions
1. How many stakeholder conversations can you realistically manage?
2. Which categories feel most accessible to start with?
3. What information would make these calls most productive?
4. How should we capture and share what you learn?
5. What support do you need to maximize conversation volume?

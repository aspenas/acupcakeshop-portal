# Vault Migration Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for migrating content from the old vault structure to the new organization pattern.

## Migration Overview

The migration will transform the current vault structure into a more organized, maintainable system that separates content from utilities and provides clear navigation pathways.

### Current Structure (Pre-Migration)

```
/acupcakeshop/
├── Athlete Financial Empowerment/    # Main content area with mixed organization
├── Dashboards/                       # Some dashboards
├── Documentation/                    # Various documentation
├── Maps/                             # Navigation maps
├── Resources/                        # Duplicative resources area
├── Scripts/                          # Utility scripts
├── System/                           # Configuration and backups
│   ├── Backups/                      # Backup files
│   ├── Configuration/                # Configuration files
│   ├── Logs/                         # Log files
│   └── Scripts/                      # Additional scripts
```

### Target Structure (Post-Migration)

```
/acupcakeshop/
├── atlas/                            # Knowledge maps and navigation
├── content/                          # Primary knowledge content
│   ├── interviews/                   # Interview content
│   ├── research/                     # Research content
│   ├── strategy/                     # Strategic planning
│   └── compliance/                   # Regulatory compliance
├── resources/                        # Supporting materials
│   ├── templates/                    # Templates
│   ├── assets/                       # Media and attachments
│   └── dashboards/                   # Performance dashboards
├── _utilities/                       # Non-content utilities
│   ├── scripts/                      # Automation scripts
│   └── config/                       # Configuration files
└── docs/                             # Vault documentation
```

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Structural Foundation (Completed)

1. ✅ Create new directory structure
2. ✅ Establish README files for each directory
3. ✅ Create atlas maps for content navigation
4. ✅ Develop templates for primary content types
5. ✅ Implement `.obsidian-ignore` for performance optimization

### Phase 2: Content Migration (In Progress)

1. ✅ Migrate player interviews
2. ⏳ Migrate industry professional interviews
3. ⏳ Migrate agent interviews
4. ⏳ Migrate research content
5. ⏳ Migrate strategy documents
6. ⏳ Migrate compliance information
7. ⏳ Standardize frontmatter and metadata

### Phase 3: Resource Consolidation (Pending)

1. ⏳ Consolidate templates from all sources
2. ⏳ Migrate dashboards and visualizations
3. ⏳ Organize and migrate attachments
4. ⏳ Update cross-references and links

### Phase 4: Utility Optimization (Pending)

1. ⏳ Refactor scripts for new directory structure
2. ⏳ Update configuration files
3. ⏳ Optimize performance considerations
4. ⏳ Implement automated backup strategy

### Phase 5: Documentation and Training (Pending)

1. ⏳ Complete vault documentation
2. ⏳ Provide user training on new structure
3. ⏳ Establish maintenance procedures
4. ⏳ Create contribution guidelines

## Migration Scripts

The following scripts have been created to assist with the migration:

- `migrate_interviews.sh`: Migrates interview content
- `migrate_research.sh`: Migrates research documents
- `migrate_strategy.sh`: Migrates strategic planning documents
- `migrate_compliance.sh`: Migrates compliance information

All scripts are located in the `_utilities/scripts/` directory.

## Verification Process

After each phase, verification will be performed:

1. Check for missing content
2. Verify link integrity
3. Ensure proper metadata
4. Validate against organizational standards

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. Backup the current state before each phase
2. Store backups in `_utilities/backups/`
3. Maintain script logs for audit purposes
4. Document rollback procedures

## Timeline

- Phase 1: April 15, 2025 (Completed)
- Phase 2: April 16-17, 2025
- Phase 3: April 18-19, 2025
- Phase 4: April 20-21, 2025
- Phase 5: April 22-23, 2025
